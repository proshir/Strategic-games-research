The impact of laws on the production of domestic cars with the lessons of strategic games

Strategic games can be used as a powerful tool in all areas of life, and through it, most everyday problems can be converted into a mathematical model and analyzed accurately.

In the strategic games course of Tehran University, we had to turn one of the country's problems into a strategic model using the lessons we learned and analyze it accurately and provide an answer.

One of the important issues in our country was the non-competitiveness of car manufacturing companies, one of the reasons for which was the lack of strict control over customs and the import of foreign cars.

We showed with the methods of strategic games what law the parliament should enact in order to solve this problem and we examined it in detail.

In fact, we turned this issue into a strategic model and made the two players the Legislative Assembly and car manufacturing companies.

This issue can be used in all countries so that they can improve the production of their factories and this is possible only by registering the laws.
